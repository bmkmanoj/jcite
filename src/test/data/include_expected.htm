<h1>JCite With Plain <span class="caps">HTML</span> Include Files</h1>


	<p>This document shows how JCite can include plain <span class="caps">HTML</span> fragment files into your main <span class="caps">HTML</span> files.</p>


<div class="toc"><ul class="toc toc1"><li><a href="#pagetoc__1">Citing An <span class="caps">HTML</span> Fragment</a></li><li><a href="#pagetoc__2">Why Does JCite Support Includes?</a></li></ul></div>

	<h2><a name="pagetoc__1">Citing An <span class="caps">HTML</span> Fragment</a></h2>


	<p>The following definition list is included from a separate <span class="caps">HTML</span> fragment file:</p>


	<dl>
<dt>Test 1</dt><dd>24 = 3 * 8<br/>18 = 3 * 6</dd>
<dt>Test 2</dt><dd>11 = 3 + 8<br/>9 = 3 + 6</dd>
</dl>


	<p>which was done using the following instruction in the source <span class="caps">HTML</span> document:</p>


<pre class="jc">[i<b></b>nc:included.htm]</pre>

	<p>The fragment file looks like this:</p>


<pre><code>&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Test 1&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;24 = 3 * 8&lt;br/&gt;18 = 3 * 6&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Test 2&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;11 = 3 + 8&lt;br/&gt;9 = 3 + 6&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
</code></pre>

	<p>Note in particular that it does not contain any <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags.</p>


	<h2><a name="pagetoc__2">Why Does JCite Support Includes?</a></h2>


	<p>This feature exists within JCite to support the citing of tested material that you cannot easily cite directly from its source.</p>


	<p>The case I encountered was when my tests ran through a complex Excel spreadsheet where the rows were structured into a series of named tests. I wanted to emit these row tests and their results into a highly customized format for presentation. So my test code now simply emits the tests and the results as an <span class="caps">HTML</span> fragment file. In the documentation source, I cite these fragment files using JCite. This ensures that the final documentation produced during a build always includes the latest test run results.</p>


	<p>If I had included them using my normal macro preprocessor during the build of the documentation source file, the include would have been too early.</p>
